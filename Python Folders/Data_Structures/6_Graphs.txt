breadth first search asks children before the children asks its children

depth first search goes deep into children before asking
depth can miss the target if it is down one of the other children
Depth uses recursive functions to search its children nodes

breath first is generally used over depth
Breadth seraches all nodes on a level before going
down and asking their children
more complex but prevents looping between nodes
uses linked list
once it looks at a node flags it as visited in a set
