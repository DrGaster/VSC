node based
data value and pointers

hierarchical
tree expands down 1 direction

head node is parent

relative to 1 node
node above is parent
node below is child


binary
can have 0, 1, or 2 children
only 1 parent
head is root

traversal is looking for a particlar nodes
iterative while loop
recursive call stacks

leaf = node with no child

branch = nodes that lead to leaf


binary search tree
balanced
0, 1, 2 children
left right
every node is more than left branch
every node is less than right branch
